# GitLab recipes: the same use as  offcial [GitLab recipes](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlab-recipes)

*But* We try to install everything from source, all GitLab dependencies(Ruby,  Redis, Nginx, Mariadb, etc.)

# Notes on the reliability of guides/scripts

* Everything has been through test in a clean, newly installed CentOS6.5/6 Minimal.
* You should read a script and understand what it does prior to running it.
* If something goes wrong during installation and you think the guide/script needs fixing, file a bug report or a submit a Pull Request.
